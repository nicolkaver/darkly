# When we analyse cookies of the website, we can see that there is a cookie with the name I-am-admin and a value d42f2da1df5ecdf29be4ac27edda0c12.

# We put it in the www.dcode.fr code detector and we find out that it means false in MD5 code.

# All we need to do is to encrypt true in MD5, put it to the cookie's value and refresh the page.

# There we find our flag.

# It is a good practice to use a strong encoding system and not simply commonly known codes that can be easily decrypted using basic and easily accessible decryption tools.
