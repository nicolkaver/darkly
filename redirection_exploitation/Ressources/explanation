# The inspection of the source code shows us that the code contains redirects to Facebook, Instagram and  Twitter pages of 42.

# We can simply change the value of redirect to anything we like and the flag appears. 

# This is worrisome because it means that it would be easy to be redirected to a malicious website.

# As a protection, we could create a list of trusted URLs for our website and always notify the user when he is being redirected to another website.
